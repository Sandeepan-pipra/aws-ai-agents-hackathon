# Logistics Manager - AI-Powered Serverless Logistics Platform

## Overview

**Logistics Manager** is an intelligent, serverless logistics orchestration system that automates end-to-end order processing, 3D packing optimization, and transportation booking using Amazon Bedrock AI agents. The system demonstrates autonomous multi-agent coordination to solve real-world supply chain challenges with 60-70% cost savings over traditional architectures.

This project was developed as part of the **AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon** to showcase the capabilities of **Amazon Bedrock Agentcore** in building production-ready autonomous systems.

[Hackathon link](https://aws-agent-hackathon.devpost.com/)

Our goal was to have meaningful extensions to our existing warehouse management solution [WarePro](https://www.pipra.solutions/warepro) to introduce autonomous logistics capabilities using Bedrock Agentcore, based on real customer pain points and industry needs. We started planning and designing on October 6th, with the aim to have a demonstration-ready solution with easy extensibility by the October 17th.

In order to have all the code in this public repository, we have added simulated orders and transport APIs with mock data. The architecture and implementation are designed to be production-ready and can be easily adapted to real-world systems.

## Solution

An autonomous AI agent system built on **Amazon Bedrock Agentcore** that:
- Automatically processes orders and coordinates logistics workflows
- Generates optimal 3D packing layouts with space utilization algorithms
- Intelligently selects vehicles and books transportation
- Consolidates multiple orders into efficient batches
- Provides real-time notifications and 3D visualization
